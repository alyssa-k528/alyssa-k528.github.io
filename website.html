                            I participated in the CMD-F hackathon in 2024, we won runner-up in HealthTech for All track and the UBC CS Hub prize
                            <br><br>   
                            We created a game that tracks users' exercise movements, and by using Tensorflow, we leveraged MoveNet to aid in user-movement tracking.
                            
                            This is an interactive game where the user must complete exercises with accurate form in order to attack their enemy, otherwise, they will be attacked

                            My team and I created a web application that takes user voice input, extracts their vocal range, and gives them their ideal karaoke song based on their pitch.
                            Backend was implemented using Flask to analyze the user voice input for their pitch range.

                            Implemented object-oriented design and programming to optimize code by restructuring its dependencies and program structure for enhanced implementation and understandability, guided by UML diagrams and use cases.
                            Created test cases to ensure the game's functionality and correctness.

                            Socket programming using TCP connections, where a multithreaded proxy server was developer with request caching to reduce latency,
                            and an origin server to handle incoming new requests. 
                            Also implemented a solution to resolve head-of-line (HOL) blocking by splitting large requests into smaller, 
                            evenly sized frames for efficient transmission.

                            Worked with socket programming, and converted the connectionless UDP to connection oriented by the use of acknowledgments 
                            and created a function that randomly drops packets for both the client and server sides. 
                            The client sends requests and both the server and client side have possibilities of dropping the packet. 
                            Functions made to deal with dropped packet scenarios as well as packet retransmissions, 
                            used timeouts and retranmissions, following the Go-Back-N protocol.
